    <p><h2>Intro</h2><em><b>I am Giovanni Perruzzi, a full-time student at Fanshawe College. I have been studying at Fanshawe College located at 1001 Fanshawe College Blvd. London, Ontario, Canada for a couple of weeks. So far, my classes have been easy.</b></em>
    <hr><h2>Background</h2><em><b>My background goes like this: Sir Isaac Brock Public School, Saunders Secondary School, Fanshawe College. I worked at Cineplex Digital Media as a Software Developer from Sep 2018 to Dec 2018 as a Co-op student. I helped make many projects, such as an RBC application that went live. I have decided to become a web developer/designer as a full-time job.</b></em>
    <hr><h2>Work</h2><em><b>As a developer/Designer in web content. I have made some websites but not that much design work. I like to design and code; the course I am taking goes well with what I want. I have made a couple websites before for myself and school, but I never had the chance to put my work into action in the work field.</b></em></p>
